- 📊 Confidence scores for extracted data
- ✏️ Edit extracted values before sending

## Development

```bash
# Serve locally (requires HTTPS for PWA features)
npx serve . -l 8080 --ssl-cert ./cert.pem --ssl-key ./key.pem

# Or use any static file server
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Note: PWA features (service worker, install prompt) require HTTPS. For local testing, use `localhost` which is exempt from the HTTPS requirement.

- AWS S3 + CloudFront

Simply upload all files in the root directory.
